### Where to Begin

I suggest you begin with [Chapter 31](#chapter-31).

### Invocation

I aspire to a style of plain English in the spirit of Strunk & White.

> Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell.

### Chapter 1

> The way which can be followed is not the true way.
>
> The name which can be said is not the true name.
>
>The nameless gives birth to Heaven and Earth<!-- (the world) -->,
>
>The named nurses The Ten Thousand Things (all things).
>
>Desireless, one sees the mystery,
>
>Desiring, one sees the surface.
>
>These two things stem from the same root,
>
>yet have different names.
>
>They are called mysterious,
>
>the most shadowy of mysteries,
>
>the gateway to all mysteries.

<!--
>
>The Way which can be spoken of is not the true way.
>
>Those without desire shall see subtlety,
>
>Those with desire will see surfaces.
-->

#### Notes

* The "10,000 Things" is a term meaning all of phenomenal reality. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10000_\(number\))



### Chapter 2

>People, through thinking one thing to be beautiful,
>
>find something else unbeautiful.
>
>Through finding one thing better,
>
>they judge another worse.
>
>Being and not—being arise together,
>
>difficult and easy give meaning to each other,
>
>long and short define each other,
>
>high and low depend upon one another,
>
>instruments and voices harmonize with each other,
>
>front and back follow upon one another.
>
>Therefore, the wise act without acting
>
>and teach without speaking.
>
>In The Ten Thousand Things (all things),
>
>the wise take matters as they come,
>
>attend to them, but do not lay claim to them,
>
>Their work is done without their dwelling on it,
>
>therefore it lasts forever.

<!--
>
>When everyone sees goodness as good,
>
>there begins the not&#8212;good.
>
>When everyone sees beauty as beautiful,
>
>there begins ugliness.
>
>People through finding one thing to be beautiful,
>
>think something else unbeautiful.
>
>Through finding one thing good,
>
>judge another bad.
>
>the wise soul takes care of matters but does not begin them,
>
>he accomplishes without taking any credit.
>
>And because he doesn't take any credit,
>
>his merit is not lost.
>
>By his not dwelling upon it, it does not leave.
-->

#### Notes

* I believe non—being here means absence or nothingness.
*  The line 'instruments and voices harmonize with each other' seems out of place in this sequence.
* The word non—being, which might be better rendered as absence.



### Chapter 3

>If the worthy are not raised above all others,
>
>people will not engage in rivalry.
>
>If what is precious is not cherished,
>
>people will not steal.
>
>If people are not offered temptation,
>
>they will not become restless.
>
>Therefore the wise govern by
>
>emptying the people's minds,
>
>and filling their bellies;
>
>calming their wills,
>
>and bracing their bones.
>
>They keep the people
>
>unknowing and undesiring,
>
>and keep the knowing from daring to act.
>
>By acting with out acting,
>
>there is no disorder.

#### Notes

* Could "become restless" be better rendered "covet"?



### Chapter 4


>The way is an empty vessel
>
>that may be drawn from
>
>without ever being filled.
>
>It is bottomless,
>
>the source of The Ten Thousand Things (all things).
>
>It blunts what is sharp,
>
>untangles what is knotted,
>
>softens the glare,
>
>settles the dust.
>
>It hardly seems to exist.
>
>We do not know who gave it birth;
>
>it is older than God.


#### Notes

* 'It hardly seems to exist' may be wrong; perhaps
* 'Yet it seems to remain hidden' or
* 'Though hidden, it seems to exist' could be a better rendering.



### Chapter 5

> Heaven and Earth (the world) are not kind;
>
>They regard The Ten Thousand Things (all things)
>
>as straw dogs (a sacrifice).
>
>Nor is the wise soul kind;
>
>He regards The Hundred Families (the common people) as straw dogs (a sacrifice).
>
>This space between Heaven and Earth,
>
>how like a bellows:
>
>though empty, it is inexhaustible;
>
>Work it, and more comes out.
>
>Many words count little;
>
>Better to keep to what's inside.

#### Notes

* 'Straw dogs' were sacrificial effigies, treated as sacred before the offering ceremony, but after which they were discarded and trampled.
* Still, 'straw dogs' may be better rendered as 'a tool' than 'a sacrifice.'
* What is meant by the 'the center' here?



### Chapter 6

>The Valley Spirit never dies;
>
>it is called the mysterious female.
>
>The gateway of the mysterious female
>
>is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
>
>Eternal, it hardly seems to exist.
>
>Yet when drawn upon, it is never exhausted.


### Notes

* The valley is an image of emptiness.


### Chapter 7


>Heaven and Earth are eternal.
>
>The reason is that they are not concerned with themselves,
>
>and so they endure.
>
>Therefore the wise
>
>places himself last, yet finds himself first;
>
>disregards himself, yet finds that he prospers.
>
>Is it not because he is unselfish,
>
>That he is able to thrive?

<!--
>
>Therefore the Sage
>
>places himself last, yet finds himself first;
>
>disregards himself, yet finds that he prospers.
>
>Is it not because he is unselfish,
>
>That he is able to thrive?
>
>disregards himself, yet finds himself in the fore;
>
>neglects himself, yet finds that he prospers.
>
>Is it not because he is selfless,
>
-->



### Chapter 8


>The greatest good is like water.
>
>Water benefits The Ten Thousand Things (all things),
>
>yet conflicts with none;
>
>it dwells in places scorned by most.
>
>In this way it holds close to the way.
>
>In dwelling, what matters is the place.
>
>In thinking, what matters is depth.
>
>In giving, what matters is being like heaven.
>
>In speaking, what matters is sincerity.
>
>In governing, what matters is order.
>
>In service, what matters is ability.
>
>In action, what matters is timeliness.
>
>By conflicting with none,
>
>no wrong is done.



### Chapter 9


>Filling a vessel to the brim
>
>is better not done.
>
>A point forged too sharp
>
>will not last.
>
>If gold and jade fill your rooms,
>
>you cannot protect them.
>
>Wealth, rank and pride
>
>bring about their own downfall.
>
>When one's role has been served, one steps aside;
>
>such is the way of Heaven.



### Chapter 10

>In nourishing the soul and embracing The One,
>
>can you do it without straying?
>
>In focusing and calming your breath,
>
>can you make it like a child's?
>
>In clarifying your self—reflection,
>
>can you rid it of imperfection?
>
>In loving the people and serving the state,
>
>can you do it without knowledge?
>
>In opening and closing the gates of Heaven,
>
>can you act the female?
>
>In comprehending The Four Reaches (every corner of the land),
>
>can you do it without knowledge?
>
>Give birth to them and care for them;
>
>give birth to them — but lay no claim to them.
>
>Care for them, but don't possess them.
>
>Lead them, but do not rule them.
>
>This is the Mysterious Virtue.

	
#### Notes
	
* 'Knowledge' is a pejorative term in this context, a lack of emptiness of the mind.
* I am dissatisfied with much of this chapter.





### Chapter 11



>Thirty spokes make a wheel;
>
>but in the space between them
>
>lies the value of the wheel.
>
>We use clay to make a vessel;
>
>but it is in emptiness
>
>that there is value to a vessel.
>
>We carve out doors and windows;
>
>on these spaces
>
>turn the value of a room.
>
>Therefore, having is beneficial;
>
>not having is useful.
>
></div>
>
><!--
>
>Therefore, what we have is valuable,
>
>and what we don't have is useful.
>
>Therefore, just as we value what is,
>
>we value what is not.
>
>-->


Notes:

* The last sentence.  Shouldn't be prescriptive. Might be better rendered as "what—is—not (also) has value."




### Chapter 12



>The Five Colors blind the eyes.
>
>Racing and hunting addles the mind.
>
>Valuables hinder one's movements.
>
>The Five Flavors dull the palate.
>
>The Five Tones deafen the ears.
>
>Therefore the wise
>
>care for the belly and not the eyes;
>
>reject that and take this.

#### Notes

* The Five Colors are green, red, yellow, white and black.
* The Five Flavors are sweet, bitter, salty, sour and pungent.
* The Five Tones are the tones of the Chinese musical scale, C, D, E, G and A.



### Chapter 13



>Both favor and disgrace cause distress.
>
>Regard suffering as you regard your very being.
>
>What is meant by 'Both favor and disgrace cause distress'?
>
>Favor debases;
>
>gaining it is a source of sorrow.
>
>losing it is a source of sorrow.
>
>This is what is meant by 'Both favor and disgrace cause distress'.
>
>What is meant by 'Regard suffering as you regard your very being'?
>
>The reason we feel pain
>
>is our bodies.
>
>If I had no body, what pain would I feel?
>
>Therefore,
>
>those who care for their own welfare
>
>no less than they care for the public good,
>
>you can entrust with the world.
>
>And to those who value themselves
>
>no more than anything else in the world,
>
>You can turn over the world.

<!--
>
>before put their problems first
>
>and the problems of the world second,
>
>who cares for themselves
>
>before tending to the world,
>
>-->



### Chapter 14



>We look but do not see it;
>
>we call it elusive.
>
>We listen but do not hear it;
>
>we call it faint.
>
>We reach but do not feel it;
>
>we call it tenuous.
>
>In these three ways it cannot be fathomed;
>
>it merges together as one.
>
>One: nothing greater is more complete;
>
>nothing less is smaller.
>
>Unending, unnamed,
>
>it returns to nothing.
>
>It is called the shapeless shape,
>
>the image of formlessness.
>
>It is called the mysterious and indistinct.
>
>Approach it and you see no front,
>
>follow it and you see no back;
>
>Hold to the way here and now
>
>to manage the present
>
>and to understand the past.
>
>This is the thread of the way.



### Chapter 15



>They of old who excelled in the way
>
>were subtle, profound, mysterious and penetrating,
>
>too deep to be understood.
>
>And because they can not be understood,
>
>I can only say:
>
>Cautious were they, like one crossing a river in Winter.
>
>Watchful, as though afraid of the neighbors.
>
>Respectful, like a guest.
>
>Yielding, like melting ice.
>
>Unformed, like uncarved wood.
>
>Open, like a valley.
>
>Murky, like muddy water.
>
>As muddy water becomes still, it gradually becomes clear.
>
>What comes to rest, gradually comes alive.
>
>Those who possess the way do not desire fullness;
>
>therefore they can wear out yet never need renewal.



### Chapter 16



>Attain utmost emptiness;
>
>maintain inner tranquility.
>
>The Ten Thousand Things (all things) arise as one
>
>and in this I see where they will return.
>
>All things flourish,
>
>but each returns from whence it came.
>
>This is called tranquility.
>
>Tranquility is to yield to your destiny.
>
>And to yield to your destiny is to know the eternal.
>
>To understand the eternal is to be wise.
>
>To not understand the eternal is to go astray,
>
>and to go astray is to court disaster.
>
>To know the eternal is to be all—embracing,
>
>to be all—embracing is to be impartial,
>
>to be impartial is to be kingly,
>
>to be kingly is to be like Heaven,
>
>to be like Heaven is to be one with the way,
>
>To be one with the way is to endure,
>
>and to be forever free from harm.



### Chapter 17



>The best leader is one
>
>whose people hardly know that they exist.
>
>Next best are those
>
>that people love and praise.
>
>Next best are those
>
>that they fear.
>
>The worst are those they despise.
>
>Those who do not trust,
>
>are themselves not trusted.
>
>The wise are few in their words.
>
>Their work is done, their affairs cared for;
>
>yet people say,
>
>"It happened of its own accord."



### Chapter 18



>When the great way is forsaken,
>
>only then do compassion and morality emerge.
>
>When knowledge and wisdom arise,
>
>only then is there great hypocrisy.
>
>When The Six Relations<!-- (all things)(our relationships) --> are not in harmony,
>
>only then do filial piety and affection appear.
>
>When the state is in disarray,
>
>only then are there virtuous officials.


#### Notes

* The Six Relations are father, son, older brother, younger brother, husband and wife.



### Chapter 19



>Do away with wisdom, set aside knowledge,
>
>and the people will benefit a hundredfold.
>
>Do away with kindness, set aside morality,
>
>and the people will be dutiful and compassionate.
>
>Do away with guile, set aside gain,
>
>and there will be no robbers or thieves.
>
>These three sayings are not sufficient;
>
>we must add:
>
>Embody plainness and embrace simplicity.
>
>Do away with self—interest and set aside desire.
>
>Do away with learning and be free of worry.



### Chapter 20



>What is the difference between yes and no?
>
>How different are beauty and ugliness?
>
>Whoever is feared by others,
>
>must also fear others.
>
>How insane; will it never end?
>
>Everyone is joyous,
>
>as though feasting at a great sacrifice
>
>or climbing a terrace in springtime.
>
>But I am quiet, not giving any sign,
>
>like an infant who has yet to smile;
>
>aimless, as though I had nowhere to go.
>
>Everyone has more than enough,
>
>I alone seem to be lacking.
>
>I have the mind of a fool, vacant and dull.
>
>Most people see clearly;
>
>I alone am in the dark.
>
>Most people make fine distinctions;
>
>I alone am muddled and confused.
>
>As vague as the ocean,
>
>As unsettled as the wind.
>
>People have their intentions,
>
>I alone am as dull as a yokel.
>
>I have a different desire;
>
>I want to drink mother's milk.



### Chapter 21



>The nature of great virtue follows from the Way alone.
>
>The nature of the Way is indefinite and vague.
>
>Vague and indefinite, but there is form within.
>
>Indefinite and vague, but there is substance within.
>
>Mysterious and shadowy, but an essence of Chi is within.
>
>This essence is real;
>
>within it is certainty.
>
>Now as in the past,
>
>its name has never gone away.
>
>By this name, we speak of the origin of all things.
>
>How do I know about the origin of all things?
>
>Through this.



### Chapter 22



>Bent over, you'll be whole;
>
>twisted, you'll be straight;
>
>hollow, you'll be full;
>
>tattered, you'll be new;
>
>having little, you'll be satisfied;
>
>having much, you'll be confused.
>
>Therefore the wise hold to the One
>
>and become shepherds to the world.
>
>Not showing off, one becomes prominent.
>
>Not justifying oneself; one shines.
>
>Not bragging, one receives credit.
>
>Not laying claim, one endures.
>
>Not competing, one has no competitor.
>
>How true the ancient saying,
>
>"Bent over, you'll be whole."
>
>Be whole, return.



### Chapter 23



>Nature says little.
>
>The wind does not blow all morning,
>
>nor does rain last all day.
>
>If nature does not insist,
>
>why should man?
>
>Those who follow the way,
>
>join the way.
>
>Whoever pursues success,
>
>attains success.
>
>Those who stray,
>
>lose their way.
>
>Those who commit to the way,
>
>the way allows in.
>
>Those who commit to undoing,
>
>the way will abandon.
>
>If you do not trust,
>
>you breed mistrust.


#### Notes

* Don't belabor matters.



### Chapter 24


>Standing on tiptoe, one is unsteady;
>
>taking great strides, one does not progress;
>
>admiring oneself, one does not shine;
>
>approving of oneself, one proves nothing;
>
>taking pride in oneself, one does not endure.
>
>In the Way, such things are called
>
>"Surplus food and redundant action,"
>
>such things are despised.
>
>Therefore, a person having the Way does not dwell on them.



### Chapter 25



>A thing chaotic yet complete,
>
>born before Heaven and Earth.
>
>Silent, formless,
>
>standing alone and unchanging.
>
>It may be the mother of Heaven and Earth.
>
>I do not know its name;
>
>I call it the Way.
>
>Were I to name it, I would call it the Great.
>
>Great also means leaving;
>
>leaving means being far away;
>
>and being far away means reverting.
>
>The Way is great;
>
>Heaven is great;
>
>Earth is great;
>
>and the king is also great.
>
>In the realm four things have greatness,
>
>and the king has a place among them.
>
>Man follows Earth;
>
>Earth follows Heaven;
>
>Heaven follows the Way;
>
>And the Way follows what just is.



### Chapter 26



>Just as the heavy is the basis of the light,
>
>calm is the mastery of agitation.
>
>A gentleman travels all day, but is never far from his luggage.
>
>When he is safely settled for the night — only then can he relax.
>
>How then can the lord of ten thousand chariots
>
>be less weighty than what he rules?
>
>If one acts lightly, one's grounding is lost;
>
>If agitated, one's mastery is lost.



### Chapter 27



>Traveling well leaves no track.
>
>Words well spoken have no flaw.
>
>Counting well needs no tally.
>
>A door well closed has neither lock nor bolt,
>
>yet cannot be opened.
>
>A knot well tied needs no rope,
>
>yet cannot be undone.
>
>Therefore the wise help all people and reject none,
>
>cultivate all things and reject none.
>
>This is called dwelling in the light.
>
>Therefore good people teach the inept,
>
>and the inept are the makings of the good.
>
>Anyone who does not value a teacher or care for a student,
>
>may have great learning, but has gone astray.
>
>This is called the essential mystery.



### Chapter 28



>Knowing the male, yet remaining female,
>
>one becomes a ravine.
>
>Being a ravine,
>
>one's virtue is not lost.
>
>Not losing one's virtue,
>
>one returns to the state of infancy.
>
>Knowing purity, yet remaining soiled,
>
>one becomes a valley.
>
>Being a valley,
>
>one's virtue is full.
>
>Having full virtue,
>
>one returns to being uncarved wood.
>
>Knowing the white, yet remaining black,
>
>one is a model for all.
>
>Being a model for all,
>
>one's virtue will not be wanting.
>
>Not wanting for virtue,
>
>one returns to limitlessness.
>
>When uncarved wood is cut, it becomes vessels;
>
>When the wise are used, they become leaders.
>
>Truly, carving well is done with the least cutting.


#### Notes

* hmm... holding to = remaining?
* sage = the wise?



### Chapter 29



>Some would take the world and act upon it,
>
>but I see that they cannot succeed.
>
>All Under Heaven (the world) is a sacred vessel;
>
>nothing is to be done to it.
>
>To tamper with it is to harm it;
>
>to grasp at it is to lose it.
>
>Some things lead, some follow;
>
>some blow hot, others cold;
>
>some are strong, others weak;
>
>some rise while others fall.
>
>Therefore the wise reject
>
>what is extreme, excessive or extravagant.



### Chapter 30



>In guiding a leader along the way,
>
>never recommend the use of violence;
>
>it is likely to backfire.
>
>Where armies go, thorns and brambles will grow.
>
>The raising of a great host is followed by a year of drought.
>
>The good general achieves his end and no more;
>
>he takes no further advantage of his victory.
>
>He achieves his end, but does not glory in it;
>
>he achieves his end, but does not boast of it;
>
>he achieves his end, but takes no pride in it;
>
>he achieves his end, but only because it had to be done.
>
>This is achieving one's end without violence.
>
>What is exalted will soon decay;
>
>This is not the way.
>
>What is not the way will soon perish.



### Chapter 31



>Weapons are cursed things,
>
>and are generally despised.
>
>Therefore one who has the way does not keep them.
>
>The gentleman at home honors the left;
>
>at war, he honors the right.
>
>Weapons are not the instrument of the gentleman;
>
>they are cursed things.
>
>When you must use them, practice restraint.
>
>Never look upon them as things of beauty.
>
>To find them beautiful is to delight in killing.
>
>One who delights in killing
>
>will not prosper All Under Heaven (in the world).
>
>In good fortune we honor the left,
>

### Chapter 32



>The way is eternal but nameless.
>
>An Uncarved Block<!-- (the world) -->, seemingly insignificant,
>
>yet nothing can subjugate it.
>
>If kings and lords had it,
>
>The Ten Thousand Things (all things) would willingly submit,

>Heaven and Earth (the world) would together send forth sweet dew,
>
>and it would naturally fall equally on all things, without law or order.
>
>Carving the block, we create names.
>
>But, having names,
>
>we must know when to stop.
>
>Knowing when to stop, you'll come to no harm.
>
>The way exists All Under Heaven (the world),
>
>as streams flow into rivers and seas.



### Chapter 33



>Understanding others, one has knowledge;
>
>understanding yourself, one has wisdom.
>
>Conquering others, one has strength;
>
>conquering yourself, one is strong.
>
>To know when you have enough is to be rich.
>
>To proceed with strength is to have purpose.
>
>To not lose track of one's place is to last long.
>
>To die but not be forgotten: that is long life.



### Chapter 34



>The way floats along;
>
>It may go left or right.
>
>The Ten Thousand Things (all things) depend upon it,
>
>yet it makes no claim to be their master
>
>and asks for nothing from them.

### Chapter 35



>Hold up the Great Image and All Under Heaven (the world) will gather.

>Coming to you, they will suffer no harm,
>
>and instead find peace and quiet.
>
>Music and food: for these a passing stranger will stop.

>so thin and flavorless.
>
>Looking at it, it cannot be seen;
>
>Listening to it, it cannot be heard;
>
>Yet using it, it cannot be cannot be used up.

#### Notes

What is meant by the great image/symbol/idea?



### Chapter 36



>To shrink a thing,
>
>You must stretch it.
>
>To weaken a thing,
>
>You must strengthen it.
>
>To cast a thing down,
>
>You must set it on high.
>
>To take from a thing,
>
>You must give to it.
>
>This is called the dim light.
>
>Thus the soft prevail over the hard
>
>and the weak overcome the strong.
>
>It is best to leave a fish in its pool;
>
>best to leave one's sharpest weapons out of sight.

#### Notes

* Arthur Waley: "The fish symbolizes armor because both have scales."



### Chapter 37



>The way is eternal, nameless.
>
>If leaders followed it,
>
>The Ten Thousand Things (all things) would transform.
>
>Being transformed, if they should stir,
>
>they would be subdued by the nameless Uncarved Block (simplicity).
>
>In the nameless Uncarved Block (simplicity),
>
>there is no desire.
>
>Without desire, All Under Heaven (the world) would be right.



### Chapter 38



>High virtue is not righteous; therefore it truly has virtue.
>
>Low virtue never loses sight of its virtue; therefore it has no true virtue.
>
>High virtue does not act and pursues no end;
>
>High humanity acts, but pursues no end;
>
>High morality acts and has its reasons for doing so;
>
>High propriety acts, and, if no one responds, then it angrily rolls up its sleeves and drags others along.
>
>When the way is lost, only then is there virtue;
>
>when virtue is lost, only then is there humanity;
>
>when humanity is lost, only then is there morality;
>
>and when morality is lost, only then is there propriety.
>
>Propriety is but the husk of loyalty and good faith, and the beginning of disorder.
>
>Foreknowledge may be 'the flower of doctrine,' but it is the beginning of folly.
>
>Therefore the full—grown person
>
>set store by the substance rather than the husk,
>
>by the fruit and not the flower.
>
>He rejects that and takes this.


#### Notes

* There is some uncertainty over the meaning of Foreknowledge here, but it seems to mean "judging a thing beforehand."  Like the next line, this is a dig at Confucianist doctrine.



### Chapter 39



>Those that have in the past attained the one:
>
>Heaven by it became clear;
>
>Earth became stable;
>
>gods became divine;
>
>valleys became full;
>
>leaders by it ruled the land.
>
>Therefore we can say:
>
>were Heaven not by it made clear, it would soon shatter;
>
>were the Earth not by it made stable, it would soon overturn;
>
>were the gods not by it made divine, they would soon wither;
>
>were valleys not by it made full, they would soon run dry;
>
>and were leaders not by it exalted, they would soon be overthrown.
>
>Therefore the exalted is rooted in the humble,
>
>and what is high rests upon what is the low.
>
>For this reason, leaders call themselves orphans, widowers, and destitute.
>
>Isn't this the mighty rooting itself in humility?
>
>They regard their many carriages as no carriage at all.
>
>They do not want to glitter like jade,
>
>but to remain as solid as stone.

#### Notes

* attained the one: comprehended?



### Chapter 40



>The way moves by returning;
>
>The way works in weakness.
>
>The things of the world originate in being,
>
>And being originates in non—being.



### Chapter 41



>The highest person hears of the way, and with diligence can practice it;
>
>the average person hears of the way, and keeps part and loses part;
>
>the lowest person hears of the Way, and laughs aloud at it.
>
>If they don't laugh at it, it is not the Way.
>
>Thus the proverb:
>
>the bright way appears dark;
>
>the way forward appears to turn back;
>
>the smoothest way appears uneven;
>
>the highest Te (virtue or power) appears as empty as a valley;
>
>what is pure appears soiled;
>
>vast Te appears inadequate;
>
>the most solid Te appears feeble;
>
>the simplest fact appears uncertain.
>
>The greatest square has no corners;
>
>the greatest vessel takes the longest to complete;
>
>the greatest music has the faintest notes;
>
>the greatest form has no shape.
>
>The way is great but has no name.
>
>Only the way cultivates all things and sees them through.

#### Notes

* Te should always be rendered by name?



### Chapter 42



>The way gave birth to the one.
>
>The one gave birth to the two.
>
>The two gave birth to the three.
>
>And the three gave birth to The Ten Thousand Things (all things).
>
>The Ten Thousand Things carry Yin on their back and hold Yang in their arms.
>
>By blending both Chi (breath), they attain harmony.
>
>What do people hate more
>
>than to be orphaned, widowed, and destitute?
>
>Yet leaders call themselves these things.
>
>Thus, some things are increased by being taken from;
>
>others are diminished by being added to.
>
>Therefore what others teach,
>
>I too will teach.
>
>"The violent will come to a violent end."
>
>I take this as the basis of my teaching.



### Chapter 43



>The most yielding of things
>
>overcomes what is most solid.
>
>Having no substance, it can enter where there is no gap.
>
>That is how I know the value of acting without acting.
>
>The wordless teaching, the value of not acting—
>
>few can understand.

#### Notes

* The symbolism here is of water and rock.



### Chapter 44



>Fame or health, which matters more?
>
>Health or wealth, which is worth more?
>
>To gain or to lose, which is worse?
>
>For greed, you will pay dearly.
>
>The more you hoard, the more you shall lose.
>
>Be content and you'll avoid disgrace.
>
>Practice restraint and you'll avoid danger,
>
>and so endure.



### Chapter 45



>What is most whole appears incomplete;
>
>yet it is never exhausted.
>
>What is most full appears empty;
>
>yet it never fails.
>
>What is most straight appears crooked.
>
>What is most skillful appears clumsy.
>
>What is most excessive appears lacking.
>
>Activity overcomes cold;
>
>calm overcomes heat.
>
>Being quiet and tranquil, All Under Heaven (the world) is set to rights.



### Chapter 46



>When the world follows the Way, riding horses are retired to fertilize the fields.
>
>When the world strays from the Way, war horses are bred even in the cities.
>
>No crime is greater than having precious things;
>
>No disaster is greater than not knowing when one has enough.
>
>No defect is greater than desire.
>
>The contentment of knowing that you have enough, is truly enduring.



### Chapter 47



>No need to leave your door to know the whole world;
>
>No need to look out your window to know the ways of Heaven.
>
>The farther you go, the less you know.
>
>The wise know without going anywhere,
>
>See without looking,
>
>And act without doing a thing.



### Chapter 48



>Those who labor in study accumulate day after day;
>
>Those who hear the way dwindle day after day.
>
>They decrease and decrease until they do nothing.
>
>They do nothing, yet nothing is left undone.
>
>To steer the world, one must be uninvolved in its affairs.
>
>Wherever one is involved in its affairs,
>
>one makes oneself unworthy of steering the world.



### Chapter 49



>The wise have no set mind;
>
>they take the outlook of The Hundred Families (the common people) as their own.
>
>Those who are good, they regard as good;
>
>those who are not, they also regard as good.
>
>Goodness is a virtue.
>
>Those who are trustworthy, they trust;
>
>those who are not, they also trust.
>
>Trust is a virtue.
>
>The wise in the world become one with it,
>
>and merge their minds with it.
>
>The Hundred Families strain their eyes and ears,
>
>and the wise are like their children.



### Chapter 50



>We come out into life and go back into death.
>
>The companions of life are thirteen;
>
>The companions of death are thirteen;
>
>Yet people by their actions move toward the thirteen that belong to death.
>
>Why?  Because of their preoccupation with life.
>
>You've heard of those who have a true hold on life:
>
>walking the hills, they don't avoid rhinos and tigers;
>
>going into battle, they carry no armor or shield.
>
>The rhino has no place to probe with its horn;
>
>the tiger finds no place to put its claws.
>
>and weapons find no place to admit their blade.
>
>And why? Because there is no place for death in them.



### Chapter 51



>The way gives birth to them, 
>
>Te (virtue or power) nourishes them,
>
>substance gives them form,
>
>and their circumstances complete them.
>
>And so The Ten Thousand Things (all things) revere the way and honor Te.
>
>They revere and honor them
>
>not by decree, but of themselves.
>
>The way gives birth to them, Te rears them, raises them, cares for them, and protects them.
>
>To give life, but lay no claim;
>
>to care for, but not possess;
>
>to lead, but not rule:
>
>this we call mysterious virtue.



### Chapter 52



>The beginning of All Under Heaven (the world)
>
>we call the mother of All Under Heaven.
>
>Knowing the mother, we know the children.
>
>Know the children, but hold to the mother
>
>and be forever safe from harm.
>
>Barricade the way, shut the doors,
>
>and you will never be exhausted.
>
>Clear the way, redouble your labors,
>
>and you will never receive help.
>
>To perceive what is small is discernment;
>
>to grasp what is fleeting is strength.
>
>Follow outward light back to insight,
>
>and be safe from harm.
>
>This is returning to the eternal.

#### Notes

* Instead of "is called", I prefer "we call" or even "is."
* "dim light" = insight?



### Chapter 53



>If I had the least bit of sense,
>
>walking on a great road
>
>I would only fear going astray.
>
>The great way is very level
>
>yet people delight in tortuous paths.
>
>The court is swept very clean
>
>but the fields are very full of weeds
>
>and the granaries stand very empty.
>
>They wear colors and embroidery,
>
>carry sharp swords at their sides,
>
>gorge themselves on food, 
>
>and have wealth to throw away.
>
>This is called thievery;
>
>and thievery isn't the Way.



### Chapter 54



>What is firmly planted can't be uprooted;
>
>what is firmly grasped can't slip free.
>
>Therefore your children and grandchildren 
>
>will carry on ancestral sacrifice forever.
>
>Cultivate your person and Te (virtue or power) will be true;
>
>cultivate your family and Te will be abundant;
>
>cultivate your village and Te will endure;
>
>cultivate your state and Te will flourish;
>
>cultivate the world and Te will reach everywhere.
>
>Examine the self by examining your self;
>
>examine family by examining your family;
>
>examine the village by examining your village;
>
>examine the state by examining your state;
>
>examine the world by examining your world;
>
>How does one know that the world is so?
>
>By this.



### Chapter 55



>Whoever is full of Te (virtue or power)
>
>is like a newborn.
>
>Wasps and scorpions, snakes and vipers do not sting them;
>
>birds of prey and wild beasts do not seize them.
>
>Their bones are soft and their muscles weak, yet their grip is firm.
>
>Ignorant of the union of male and female, yet their organ is aroused —
>
>because their essence is at its height.
>
>They scream all day without becoming hoarse —
>
>because their harmony is at its height.
>
>To know harmony is to know the eternal;
>
>To know the eternal is to be wise.
>
>Trying to extend one's life is a bad omen;
>
>controlling one's breath is forcing things.
>
>Whatever reaches its prime, then begins to decay;
>
>this is not the way,
>
>and whatever is not the way will soon end.

#### Notes

* 'What is exalted will soon decay' vs. 'What has reached its prime has begun to decay.'

Or: That which is in its prime will never be better.
Or: After you reach your prime, it's all downhill.



### Chapter 56



>Those who know, don't say; 
>
>those who say, don't know.
>
>They block the way,
>
>close the doors,
>
>soften the glare,
>
>settle the dust,
>
>blunt what is sharp,
>
>and untangle what is knotted —
>
>this is called mysterious balance.
>
>Therefore, one cannot engage them,
>
>but one cannot shun them.
>
>One cannot help them,
>
>but one cannot harm them.
>
>One cannot glorify them,
>
>but one cannot humble them.
>
>For this reason, they are the most noble Under Heaven (in the world).

#### Notes

* For tong: union, equality, parity, balance.



### Chapter 57



>Govern the kingdom by keeping the rules.
>
>Win the war by breaking the rules.
>
>Gain the loyalty of Under Heaven (the world) by inaction.
>
>How do I know which is true?  By this:
>
>The more taboos there are, the poorer the people shall be;
>
>the more sharp weapons (clever people) there are, the more chaotic the land shall be;
>
>the more cunning people are, the more contrivances shall appear;
>
>the more that laws are dwelled upon, the more thieves there shall be.
>
>Therefore, the wise say:
>
>do nothing, and the people evolve on their own;
>
>cherish tranquility, and the people sort themselves out;
>
>stay uninvolved, and the people will prosper on their own.
>
>desire nothing, and the people will be Uncarved Block (simple, genuine).



### Chapter 58



>The less that leaders do,
>
>the happier the people are.
>
>When leaders meddle,
>
>the people rebel.
>
>Good fortune requires misfortune;
>
>misfortune lies hidden within good fortune.

>Who can say where one ends and the other begins?
>
>Nothing is straightforward;
>
>what is right goes wrong;

>virtue goes astray.

>
>Therefore the wise
>
>are upright without being over-bearing;
>
>are sharp but don't cut;
>

### Chapter 59



>In leadership, less is more.
>
>By doing less, one starts down the way.
>
>Following the way, one does right.
>
>And in doing right, one prevails.
>
>If you can prevail, nothing is impossible.
>
>If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits.

>Having no limits, one is fit to lead.
>
>Take care of what really matters,

>Plant deep roots and you will thrive.
>
>That's the Way to live long and see clearly.





### Chapter 60



>Rule a large kingdom as you would cook a small fish.
>
>Follows the way, and the dead will not come back to haunt you.
>
>They remain powerful, but will do no harm.
>
>Not only will they do no harm, 
>
>the wise leader will do no harm either.
>
>With no harm done by either side,
>
>Well-being will flow.





### Chapter 61



>A large kingdom is like a river
>
>into which many streams flow,
>
>a very feminine thing
>
>where everything comes together.
>
>Woman conquers man by yielding
>
>and humbling herself before him.

>Like low-lying land,

>A large kingdom can win over

>a small kingdom by being humble.
>
>A small kingdom can join
>
>a large kingdom by being humble.
>
>One humbles itself and takes over,
>
>the other humbles itself and is taken over.
>
>A large kingdom wants to unite and care for the people.
>
>A small kingdom wants to join and serve others.
>
>Both succeed by yielding,
>
>and it is fitting that a large kingom humble itself.





### Chapter 62



>The way is a sanctuary for all.
>
>It is a good person's treasure,
>
>and the lost soul's refuge.
>
>Beautiful words are cheap,
>
>noble deeds are free;
>
>If a thing isn't valued - 
>
>will it be appreciated?
>
>When the king is crowned
>
>and his ministers take power,
>
>while others offer parades and precious gifts,
>
>remain still and offer the way.
>
>Why has it been prized since ancient times?
>
>Because through the way

>whatever we seek, we find;

>and whoever has erred, is forgiven.
>
>That is why it is the most precious thing in the world.

>And if you abandon this frugality and yet try to be magnanimous,
>
>And if you abandon this staying behind and yet go to the fore,
>
>Then you will die.
>
>If with compassion you attack, then you'll win;
>
>If you defend, then you'll stand firm.
>
>When Heaven's about to establish him,
>
>It's as though he surrounds him with the protective wall of compassion.

>
>68
>
>Therefore, one who is good at being a warrior doesn't make a show of his might;
>
>One who is good in battle doesn't get angry;
>
>One who is good at defeating the enemy doesn't engage him.
>
>And one who is good at using men places himself below them.
>
>This is called the virtue of not competing;
>
>This is called [correctly] using men;
>
>This is called matching Heaven.
>
>It's the high point of the past.

>69
>
>Those who use weapons have a saying which goes:
>
>"I don't presume to act like the host, and instead play the part of the guest;
>
>I don't advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot."
>
>This is called moving forward without moving forword&#8212;
>
>Rolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms&#8212;
>
>Grasping firmly without holding a weapon&#8212;
>
>And enticing to fight when there's no opponent.
>
>Of disasters, none is greater than [thinking] you have no rival.
>
>To think you have no rival is to come close to losing my treasures.
>
>Therefore, when weapons are raised and [the opponents] are farily well matched,
>
>Then it's the one who feels grief that will win.
>
>
>70
>
>My words are easy to understand,
>
>And easy to put into practice.
>
>Yet no one in the world can understand them,
>
>And no one can put them into practice.
>
>Now my words have an ancestor, and my deeds have a lord,
>
>And it's simply because [people] have no understanding [of them], that they therefore don't understand me.
>
>But when those who understand me are few, then I'm of great value.
>
>Therefore the Sage wears coarse woolen cloth, but inside it he holds on to jade.
>
>
>71
>
>To know you don't know is best.
>
>Not to know you [don't] know is a flaw.
>
>Therefore, the Sage's not being flawed
>
>Stems from his recognizing a flaw as a flaw.
>
>Therefore, he is flawless.
>
>
>72
>
>When the people don't respect those in power, then what they greatly fear is about to arrive.
>
>Don't narrow the size of the places in which they live;
>
>Don't oppress them in their means of livelihood.
>
>It's simply because you do not oppress them, that they therefore will not be fed up.
>
>Therefore the Sage knows himself but doesn't show himself;
>
>he cherishes himself but doesn't value himself.
>
>For this reason, he rejects that and takes this.
>
>
>73
>
>If you're brave in being daring, you'll be killed;
>
>If you're brave in not being daring, you'll live.
>
>With these two things, in one case there's profit, in the other there's harm.
>
>The things Heaven hates&#8212;who knows why?
>
>The Way of Heaven is not to fight yet to be good at winning&#8212;
>
>Not to speak yet skillfully respond&#8212;
>
>No one summons it, yet it comes on its own&#8212;
>
>To be at ease yet carefully plan.
>
>Heaven's net is large and vast;
>
>Its mesh may be coarse yet nothing slips through.
>
>
>74
>
>If the people were constant [in their behavior] and yet did not fear death,
>
>How could you use execution to intimidate them?
>
>If you brought it about that the people were constant [in their behavior] and moreover feared, and [we] took those who behaved in abnormal ways and killed them&#8212;who would dare act in this way?!
>
>If the people are constant and moreover necessarily fear death, then we constantly have the one in charge of executions.
>
>Now killing people in place of the one in charge of executions, this [is like] cutting wood in place of the head carpenter.
>
>And of those who cut wood in place of the head carpenter, very few do not hurt their hands!
>
>
>75
>
>The reason why people starve,
>
>Is because they take so much in tax&#8212;grain.
>
>Therefore they starve.
>
>The reason why the common people cannot be ruled,
>
>Is because their superiors have their reason for acting.
>
>Therefore they cannot be ruled.
>
>The reason why people take death lightly,
>
>Is because they so avidly seek after life.
>
>Therefore they take death lightly.
>
>Only those who do not act for the purpose of living&#8212;
>
>Only these are superior to those who value life.
>
>
>76
>
>When people are born, they're supple and soft;
>
>Whey they die, they end up stretched out firm and rigid;
>
>When the ten thousand things and grasses and trees are alive, they're supple and pliant;
>
>When they're dead, they're withered and dried out.
>
>Therefore we say that the firm and rigid are compassions of death,
>
>While the supple, the soft, the weak, and the delicate are compassions of life.
>
>If a soldier is rigid, he won't win;
>
>If a tree is rigid, it will come to its end.
>
>Rigidity and power occupy the inferior position;
>
>Suppleness, softness, weakness, and delicateness occupy the superior position.
>
>
>77
>
>The Way of Heaven is like the flexing of a bow.
>
>The high it presses down; the low it raises up.
>
>From those with a surplus it takes away; to those without enough it adds on.
>
>Therefore the way of Heaven&#8212;
>
>Is to reduce the excessive and increase the insufficient;
>
>The Way of Man&#8212;
>
>Is to reduce the insufficient and offer more to the excessive.
>
>Now, who is able to have a surplus and use it to offer to Heaven?
>
>Clearly, it's only the one who possesses the Way.
>
>Therefore the Sage&#8212;
>
>Take actions but does not possess them;
>
>Accomplishes his tasks but does not dwell on them.
>
>Like this, is his desire not to make a display of his worthiness.
>
>
>78
>
>In the whole world, nothing is softer and weaker than water.
>
>And yet for attacking the hard and strong, nothing can bear it,
>
>Because there is nothing you can use to replace it.
>
>That water can defeat the unyielding&#8212;
>
>That the weak can defeat the strong&#8212;
>
>There is no one in the whole world who doesn't know it,
>
>And yet there is no one who can put it into practice.
>
>For this reason, the words of the Sage say:
>
>To take on yourself the disgrace of the state&#8212;this is called being the lord of [the altars of] earth and grain;
>
>To assume responsibility for all ill&#8212;omened events in the state&#8212;this is called being the king of the world.
>
>Correct words seem to say the reverse [of what you expect them to say].
>
>
>79
>
>To make peace where there has been great resentment, there is bound to be resentment left over.
>
>How could this be regarded as good?
>
>Therefore the Sage [holds] the right tally yet makes no demands of others.
>
>For this reason, those who have virtue are in charge of the tally;
>
>Those without virtue are in charge of the taxes.
>
>The Way of Heaven has no favorites,
>
>It's always with the good man.

>[7a Virtue&#8212;3,041 (characters)]

>
>Let the country be small and people few&#8212;

>Bring it about that there are weapons for "tens" and "hundreds," yet let no one use them;

>Have the people regard death gravely and put migrating far from their minds.
>
>Though they might have boats and carriages, no one will ride them;
>
>Though they might have armor and spears, no one will display them.
>
>Have the people return to knotting cords and using them.

>They will relish their food,

>Regard their clothing as beautiful,

>Delight in their customs,
>
>And feel safe and secure in their homes.

>Neighboring states might overlook one another,

>And the sounds of chickens and dogs might be overheard,

>Yet the people will arrive at old age and death with no comings and goings between them.
